# dodo-lang
A language for the coming decline of civilization

Have a look in the examples/ folder to get an idea of the syntax and semantics of the language.

### Building
Just run the build.py script with any modern Python 3 version. You'll need to have a relatively recent version of the MSVC compiler tools (cl.exe) in your path.
