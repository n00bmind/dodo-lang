2021-01-09   Arrays without a size specifier

Decided against allowing declaring arrays without a size ([]), as that'd mean they cannot be bounds-checked, which is
inconsistent with all other array and buffer view types. This is made worse by the fact we're gonna want to separate
array and pointer-math semantics, by making the first more 'reassuring' in the sense that it'll always be bounds checked.
